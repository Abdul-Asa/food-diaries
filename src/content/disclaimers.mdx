# Disclaimers

A few things to be clear about when reading these reviews:

- **Personal project.** This site is run by one person. It's a hobby, not a business. Purely for fun and to share my love for kebabs.
- **No sponsorship.** No one pays for reviews or placement (I wish). All opinions are independent.
- **No hate.** I don't set out to trash any restaurant. Reviews are honest first impressions and experiences — good or bad — not personal attacks.
- **Opinions only.** Taste is subjective. What I like might not be your thing, and vice versa. I don't really have a fine taste. I'd eat just about any kebab.

If you have a correction, want to get in touch, want me to remove a review, or even want to sponsor me for free kebab reviews, [contact me](/contact).
