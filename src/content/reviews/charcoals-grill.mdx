### First Impressions

This spot is a serious contender in the Southampton student kebab scene.
Late-night queues, loud conversations, and the smell of rotating meat define the atmosphere.

### Quality

The meat is properly carved, not hacked.
Seasoning is noticeable without being overpowering.
Garlic sauce ratio is balanced.

Chips are golden on good days — slightly soft at peak chaos hours.

### Aesthetic

Wrap structure holds.
Foil wrapping tight.
No catastrophic leakage.

Certified mkebabHD tier.

### Portion Size

Generous. You will not leave hungry.
Student-approved fullness rating: high.

### Price

Competitive for Southampton.
Reasonable for portion size.

### Verdict

Reliable. Solid. Respectable.

Would revisit after a night out without hesitation.
