The standout dish was their Truffle Toro Tartare - a perfect balance of rich fatty tuna enhanced by earthy truffle notes. The presentation was nothing short of artistic, making each dish Instagram-worthy without sacrificing taste.

The staff's knowledge of the menu was impressive, offering thoughtful recommendations and explaining each dish's preparation in detail. The timing between courses was perfectly paced.
