# About the diary

We're a small team who love kebabs and hate fake reviews. This site is our honest take on kebab spots in Southampton — no sponsorships, no free meals, no agenda.

## How we review

We visit each spot, order the same kind of thing where we can, and score on **quality**, **aesthetic**, **price**, and **value**. The overall score is our gut feeling: would we go back?

## Where we cover

Right now we're focused on **Southampton** (SO14–SO17 and nearby). If you run a spot and want us to visit, get in touch via the [contact page](/contact).

## Why "Saints"?

Southampton FC are the Saints. We're here for the city, the food, and the late-night runs. UTFS.
