## Our Story

Food Diaries started as a simple passion project between friends who were tired of disappointing takeaway experiences. What began as casual conversations about the best kebab spots in Southampton has evolved into the city's most comprehensive guide to authentic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.

We believe that great food brings people together, and every neighborhood deserves to know where to find their next favorite meal.

## Our Values

**Authenticity First**: We celebrate traditional recipes and genuine cooking methods that have been passed down through generations.

**Community Focused**: Supporting local businesses and helping food lovers discover new favorites in their own backyard.

**Quality Over Quantity**: We'd rather review fewer places thoroughly than rush through superficial coverage.

**Accessibility**: Great food should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget or dietary requirements.
