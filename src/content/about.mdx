# About the diary

This isn't your usual food review blog, so bear with me. Saints Food Diary was created to capture the full kebab experience that the average Southampton local actually cares about.

It's not just about the meat. It's about the whole thing — the bread, the sauces, the portions, the price, and whether the packaging survives the walk home at 2am.

## How I score

Every spot gets rated on four things. Here's what a perfect score looks like:

<div className="flex justify-center pb-8">
  <ScoreCard
    className="w-full max-w-md"
    score={{
      aesthetic: 5,
      overall: 5,
      price: "££",
      quality: 5,
      value: "Amazing Deal",
    }}
  />
</div>

- **Quality** — Meat freshness, portion size, bread, and that crucial sauce balance. Scored out of 5.
- **Aesthetic** — Vibes matter. The packaging, the presentation. Can I post it on my story? Scored out of 5.
- **Price** — £ to £££. Simple.
- **Value** — Amazing Deal, Good, Okay, or Not worth. Based on everything else.

The overall score is my gut feeling. Would I go back? Would I recommend it to a mate? That's what it comes down to.

## The average kebab run

You don't care about Michelin stars. You're not here for fine dining critique. You're here because it's late, you're hungry, and you want to know one thing: where's the best kebab near me?

Is the portion decent? Is it worth the price? Will I regret this tomorrow? These are the questions that matter. And that's exactly what I try to answer.

## Something other than the big chains

Southampton's got some unreal independent kebab spots that most people walk right past. The goal here is to point you towards the spots that deserve your money — the family-run grills, the hidden gems on side streets, the places your mate swears by but you've never tried.

Here's to more great kebabs.
