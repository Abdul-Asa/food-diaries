## FAQ

**Do you accept payment for reviews?**  
Never. All our reviews are completely independent and unbiased. We pay for our own meals to ensure authentic experiences.

**How often do you publish new reviews?**  
We aim to publish 2-3 comprehensive reviews each month, focusing on quality over quantity.

**Can restaurants request a review?**  
While restaurants can suggest themselves for review, this doesn't guarantee coverage. All restaurants are evaluated using the same criteria.

**Do you cater to different dietary requirements?**  
Absolutely! We always note vegetarian, vegan, and halal options in our reviews when available.
